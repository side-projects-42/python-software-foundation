\fBroundup-server\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fBname=\fP\fItracker home\fP]*
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-C\fP \fIfile\fP
Use options read from the configuration file (see below).
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fIhostname\fP

(127.0.0.1). Use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces on the system.
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIport\fP
Sets the port to listen on (default: 8080).
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIfile\fP
Daemonize, and write the server's PID to the nominated file.
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIfile\fP
Sets a filename to log to (instead of stdout). This is required if the -d
option is used.
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIfile\fP
Sets a filename to use as a template for generating the tracker index page.
The variable "trackers" is available to the template and is a dict of all
configured trackers.
.TP
\fB-s\fP
Enables to use of SSL.
.TP
\fB-e\fP \fIfile\fP
Sets a filename containing the PEM file to use for SSL. If left blank, a
temporary self-signed certificate will be used.
.TP
\fB-N\fP

.TP
\fB-u\fP \fIUID\fP
Runs the Roundup web server as this UID.
.TP
\fB-g\fP \fIGID\fP
Runs the Roundup web server as this GID.
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIPIDfile\fP
Run the server in the background and write the server's PID
to the file indicated by PIDfile. The -l option \fBmust\fP be
specified if -d is used.
.TP
\fB-v\fP
Print version and exit.
.TP
\fB-h\fP
Print help and exit.
.TP
\fBname=\fP\fItracker home\fP
Sets the tracker home(s) to use. The \fBname\fP variable is how the tracker is
identified in the URL (it's the first part of the URL path). The \fItracker
home\fP variable is the directory that was identified when you did
"roundup-admin init". You may specify any number of these name=home pairs on
the command-line. For convenience, you may edit the TRACKER_HOMES variable in
the roundup-server file instead.  Make sure the name part doesn't include any
url-unsafe characters like spaces, as these confuse the cookie handling in
browsers like IE.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B roundup-server -p 9000 bugs=/var/tracker reqs=/home/roundup/group1
Start the server on port \fB9000\fP serving two trackers; one under
\fB/bugs\fP and one under \fB/reqs\fP.
