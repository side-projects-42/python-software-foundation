PostgreSQL/psycopg Backend
==========================

This are notes about PostqreSQL backend based on the psycopg adapter for
Roundup issue tracker.

Prerequisites
=============

To use PostgreSQL as backend for storing roundup data, you should
additionally install:

1. PostgreSQL 8.x or higher - https://www.postgresql.org/

2. The psycopg python interface to PostgreSQL:

     http://initd.org/psycopg/


Running the PostgreSQL unit tests
=================================

The user that you're running the tests as will need to be able to access
the postgresql database on the local machine and create and drop
databases. See the config values in 'test/db_test_base.py' 
about which database connection, name and user will be used.
