.SH DESCRIPTION
The roundup mail gateway may be called in one of three ways:
.IP \(bu
with an instance home as the only argument,
.IP \(bu
with both an instance home and a mail spool file, or
.IP \(bu
with both an instance home and a pop server account.
.PP
\fBPIPE\fP
.br
In the first case, the mail gateway reads a single message from the
standard input and submits the message to the roundup.mailgw module.

\fBUNIX mailbox\fP
.br
In the second case, the gateway reads all messages from the mail spool
file and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module. The file is
emptied once all messages have been successfully handled. The file is
specified as:
 \fImailbox /path/to/mailbox\fP

In all of the following the username and password can be stored in a
~/.netrc file. In this case only the server name need be specified on
the command-line.

The username and/or password will be prompted for if not supplied on
the command-line or in ~/.netrc.

\fBPOP\fP
.br
In the third case, the gateway reads all messages from the POP server
specified and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module. The
server is specified as:
 \fBpop\fP \fIusername\fP\fB:\fP\fIpassword\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver\fP
.br
The username and password may be omitted:
 \fBpop\fP \fIusername\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver\fP
 \fBpop\fP \fIserver\fP
.br
are both valid. The username and/or password will be prompted for if
not supplied on the command-line.

\fBAPOP\fP
.br
Same as POP, but using Authenticated POP:
 \fBapop\fP \fIusername\fP\fB:\fP\fIpassword\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver\fP

\fBIMAP\fP
.br
Connect to an IMAP server. This supports the same notation as that of
POP mail.
 \fBimap\fP \fIusername\fP\fB:\fP\fIpassword\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver\fP
.br
It also allows you to specify a specific mailbox other than INBOX using
this format:
 \fBimap\fP \fIusername\fP\fB:\fP\fIpassword\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver mailbox\fP

\fBIMAPS\fP
.br
Connect to an IMAP server over ssl.
This supports the same notation as IMAP.
 \fBimaps\fP \fIusername\fP\fB:\fP\fIpassword\fP\fB@\fP\fIserver\fP [\fImailbox\fP]
