======================================
Upgrading to newer versions of Roundup
======================================

Please read each section carefully and edit your tracker home files
accordingly. Note that there is information about upgrade procedures in the
`administration guide`_.

If a specific version transition isn't mentioned here (eg. 0.6.7 to 0.6.8)
then you don't need to do anything. If you're upgrading from 0.5.6 to
0.6.8 though, you'll need to check the "0.5 to 0.6" and "0.6.x to 0.6.3"
steps.

**IMPORTANT** The v1.5.x releases of Roundup were the last to support
Python v2.5 and v2.6.  Starting with the v1.6 releases of Roundup
v2.7.2 is required to run newer releases of Roundup.

Migrating from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0
=============================

Update tracker config file
--------------------------

After installing the new version of roundup, you should
update the ``config.ini`` file for your tracker. To do this:

 1. backup your existing ``config.ini`` file
 2. using the newly installed code, run::

       roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig config.ini.new

    to create the file config.ini.new. Replace
    ``/path/to/tracker`` with the path to your tracker.
 3. replace your tracker's config.ini with config.ini.new

Using updateconfig keeps all the settings from your
tracker's config.ini file and adds settings for all the new
options.

If you have added comments to your original config.ini file,
merge the added comments into the config.ini.new file.  Then
replace your tracker's config.ini with config.ini.new.

Read the new config.ini and configure it to enable new
features. Details on using these features can be found in
this section.

Make sure that user can view labelprop on classes (REQUIRED)
------------------------------------------------------------

If you have View permissions that use ```properties=...```,
make sure that the labelprop for the class is listed in the
properties list.

The first one of these that exists must must be in the list:

 1. the property set by a call to setlabelprop for the class
 2. the key of the class (as set by setkey())
 3. the "name" property (if it exists)
 4. the "title" property (if it exists)

if none of those apply, you must allow

 * the "id" property

E.G. If your class does a setlabelprop("foo") you must include "foo"
in the properties list even if the class has name or title properties.

See:
http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/customizing.html#setlabelprop-property
for further details on the labelprop.

If you don't do this, you will find that multilinks (and possibly
links) may not be displayed properly. E.G. templates that iterate over
a mutlilink field (with tal:repeat for example) may not show any
content.

See: https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/message/35763294/
for the initial discussion of the issue.

Cross Site Request Forgery Detection Added
------------------------------------------

Roundup 1.6. supports a number of defenses against CSRF.

Http header verification against the tracker's ``web``
setting in the ``[tracker]`` section of config.ini for the
following headers:

 1. Analyze the ``Referer`` HTTP header to make sure it
    includes the web setting.
 2. Analyze the ``Origin`` HTTP header to make sure the
    schema://host matches the web setting.
 3. Analyze the ``X-Forwarded-Host`` header set by a proxy
    running in front of roundup to make sure it agrees with
    the host part of the web setting.
 4. Analyze the ``Host`` header to make sure it agrees with
    the host part of the web setting. This is not done if
    ``X-Forwarded-Host`` is set.

By default roundup 1.6 does not require any specific header
to be present. However at least one of the headers above
*must* pass validation checks (usually ``Host`` or
``Referer``) or the submission is rejected with an error.
If any header fails validation, the submission is
rejected. (Note the user's form keeps all the data they
entered if it was rejected.)

Also the admin can include unique csrf tokens for all forms
submitted using the POST method. (Delete and put methods are also
included, but not currently used by roundup.) The csrf
token (nonce) is tied to the user's session. When the user
submits the form and nonce, the nonce is checked to make
sure it was issued to the user and the same session. If this
is not true the post is rejected and the user is notified.

The standard context/submit templating item creates CSRF tokens by
default. If you have forms using the POST method that are not using
the standard submit routine, you should add the following field to all
forms:

   <input name="@csrf" type="hidden"
      tal:attributes="value python:utils.anti_csrf_nonce()">

A unique random token is generated by every call to
utils.anti_csrf_nonce() and is put in a database to be
retreived if the token is used. Token lifetimes are 2 weeks
by default but can be configured in config.ini. Roundup will
automatically prune old tokens. Calling anti_csrf_nonce with
an integer lifetime, for example:

   <input name="@csrf" type="hidden"
      tal:attributes="value python:utils.anti_csrf_nonce(lifetime=10)">

sets the lifetime of that nonce to 10 minutes.

If you want to change the default settings, you have to
update the web section in your tracker's config.ini file. Follow the
section above to generate an updated config.ini file. Then
look for settings that start with csrf. The updated config.ini
file includes detailed descriptions of the settings.

In general one of four values can be set for these
settings. The default is ``yes``, which validates the header
or nonce and blocks access if the validation fails. If the
field/header is missing it allows access. Setting these
fields to ``required`` blocks access if the header/nonce is
missing.

It is recommended that you change your templates so every form
that is not submitted via GET has an @csrf field. Then change
the csrf_enforce_token setting to 'required'.

Errors and Troubleshooting - @csrf in url
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the @csrf nonce in the URL, you have added the value to a
form that uses the GET method. You should remove the @csrf token from
these forms as it is not needed.

Errors and Troubleshooting - AttributeError list object no attribute value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you get an error:

  AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'value'

in handle_csrf, you have more than one @csrf token for the form. This
usually occurs because the form uses the standard context/submit
element but you also added an explicit @csrf statement. Simply remove
the @csrf element for that form.

Errors and Troubleshooting - xmlrpc Required Header Missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When performing and xmlrpc call, if you see something like:

  xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "<class
     'roundup.exceptions.UsageError'>:Required Header Missing">

change the setting of csrf_enforce_header_x-requested-with in
config.ini to no. So it looks like:

  csrf_enforce_header_x-requested-with = no

Alternatively change your xmlrpc client to add appropriate headers to
the request including the:

  X-Requested-With:

header as well as any other required csrf headers (e.g. referer, origin)
configured in config.ini. See the advanced python client at the end of 
the `xmlrpc guide`_.

Support for SameSite cookie option for session cookie
-----------------------------------------------------

Support for serving the session cookie using the SameSite cookie option
has been added. By default it is set to lax to provide a better user
experience. But this can be changes to strict or the option can be
removed entirely.

Using the process for merging config.ini changes described in
`Cross Site Request Forgery Detection Added`_ you can add the
``samesite_cookie_setting`` to the ``[web]`` section of the config
file.

Fix for path traversal changes template resolution
--------------------------------------------------

The templates in the tracker's html subdirectory must not be
symbolic links that lead outside of the html directory.

If you don't use symbolic links for templates in your html
subdirectory you don't have to make any changes. Otherwise you need to
replace the symbolic links with hard links to the files or replace the
symbolic links with the files.

This is a side effect of fixing a path traversal security issue.  The
security issue required a directory with a specific unusual name. This
made it difficult to exploit. However allowing the use of
subdirectories to organize the templates required that it be fixed.


Database back end specified in config.ini (REQUIRED)
----------------------------------------------------

The ``db/backend_name`` file is no longer used to configure the database
backend being used for a tracker. The backend is now configured in the
``config.ini`` file using the ``backend`` option located in the ``[rdbms]``
section. For example if ``db/backend_name`` file contains ``sqlite``, a new
entry in the tracker's ``config.ini`` will need to be created::

  [rdbms]

  ...

  # Database backend.
  # Default:
  backend = sqlite

Once the ``config.ini`` file has been updated with the new ``backend`` option,
you can safely delete the ``db/backend_name`` file.

Note: the ``backend_name`` file may be located in a directory other than
``db/`` if you have configured the ``database`` option in the ``[main]``
section of the ``config.ini`` file to be something other than ``db``.

Note 2: if you are using the anydbm back end, you still set
it using the backend option in the rdbms section of the
config.ini file.

New config file option 'indexer' added
--------------------------------------

This release added support for the Whoosh indexer, so a new
config file option has been
added. You can force Roundup to use a particular text indexer by
setting this value in the [main] section of the tracker's
``config.ini`` file (usually placed right before indexer_stopwords)::

  [main]

  ...

  # Force Roundup to use a particular text indexer.
  # If no indexer is supplied, the first available indexer
  # will be used in the following order:
  # Possible values: xapian, whoosh, native (internal).
  indexer =

Errors and Troubleshooting - Full text searching not working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If after the upgrade full text searching is not working try changing
the indexer value. If this is failing most likely you need to set
'''indexer = native''' to use the rdbms or db text indexing systems.

Alternatively you can do a
'''roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker reindex'''
to generate a new index using roundup's preferred indexer from the list above.

Stemming improved in Xapian Indexer
-----------------------------------

Stemming allows a search for "silent" also match silently.  The Porter
stemmer in Xapian works with lowercase English text. In this release we
lowercase the documents as they are put into the indexer.

This means capitalization is not preserved, but produces more hits by
using the stemmer.

You will need to do a roundup-admin reindex if you are using the
Xapian full text indexer on your tracker.


New config file option 'replyto_address' added
----------------------------------------------

A new config file option has been added to let you control the
Reply-To header on nosy messages.

Edit your tracker's ``config.ini`` and place the following after
the email entry in the tracker section::

  [tracker]
  ...

  # Controls the reply-to header address used when sending
  # nosy messages.
  # If the value is unset (default) the roundup tracker's
  # email address (above) is used.
  # If set to "AUTHOR" then the primary email address of the
  # author of the change will be used as the reply-to
  # address. This allows email exchanges to occur outside of
  # the view of roundup and exposes the address of the person
  # who updated the issue, but it could be useful in some
  # unusual circumstances.
  # If set to some other value, the value is used as the reply-to
  # address. It must be a valid RFC2822 address or people will not be
  # able to reply.
  # Default: 
  replyto_address = 

Login from a search or after logout works better (REQUIRED)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The login form has been improved to work with some back end code
changes. Now when a user logs in they stay on the same page where they
started the login. To make this work, you must change the tal that is
used to set the ``__came_from`` form variable. Note that the url
assigned to __came_from must be url encoded/quoted and be under the
tracker's base url. If the base_url uses http, you can set the url to 
https.

Replace the existing code in the tracker's html/page.html page that
looks similar to (look for name="__came_from")::

  <input type="hidden" name="__came_from" tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

with the following::

  <input type="hidden" name="__came_from"
    tal:condition="exists:request/env/QUERY_STRING"
    tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}?${request/env/QUERY_STRING}">
  <input type="hidden" name="__came_from"
    tal:condition="not:exists:request/env/QUERY_STRING"
    tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

Now search backwards for the nearest form statement before the code
that sets __came_from. If it looks like::

     <form method="post" action="#">

replace it with::

     <form method="post" tal:attributes="action request/base">

or with::

     <form method="post" tal:attributes="action string:${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

the important part is that the action field **must not** include any query
parameters ('#' includes query params).

Errors and Troubleshooting - Unrecognized scheme in ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One symptom of failing to do this is getting an error:

   Unrecognized scheme in ....

where the .... changes depending on the url path. You can see this
when logging in from any screen other than the main index.

Option to make adding multiple keywords more convenient
-------------------------------------------------------

In the classic tracker, after adding a new keyword you are redirected
to the page for the new keyword so you can change the keyword's
name. This is usually not desirable as you usually correctly set the
keyword's name when creating the keyword. The new classic tracker has
a new checkbox (checked by default) that keeps you on the same page so
you can add a new keywords one after the other.

To add this to your own tracker, add the following code (prefixed with
a +) after the entry box for the new keyword in html/keyword.item.html::

      <tr>
       <th i18n:translate="">Keyword</th>
       <td tal:content="structure context/name/field">name</td>
   +   <td tal:condition="not:context/id">
   +     <tal:comment tal:replace="nothing">
   +       If we get here and do not have an id, we are creating a new
   +       keyword. It would be nice to provide some mechanism to
   +       determine the preferred state of the "Continue adding keywords"
   +       checkbox. By default it is enabled.
   +     </tal:comment>
   +     <input type="checkbox" id="continue_new_keyword"
   +           name="__redirect_to"
   +           tal:attributes="value
   +                           string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}?@template=item;
   +                           checked python:True" />
   +     <label for="continue_new_keyword" i18n:translate="">Continue adding keywords.</label>
   +   </td>
      </tr>

Note remove the leading '+' when adding this to the templates.

The key component here is support for the '__redirect_to' query
property. It is a url which can be used when creating any new item
(issue, user, keyword ....). It controls the next page displayed after
creating the item. If '__redirect_to' is not set, then you end up on
the page for the newly created item. The url value assigned to
__redirect_to must start with the tracker's base url and must be properly
url encoded.

Helper popups trigger change events on the original page
--------------------------------------------------------

The helper popups used to set dates (from a calendar), change lists of
users or lists of issues did not notify the browser that the fields
had been changed. This release adds code to trigger the change event.

To add the change event to the calendar popup, you don't need to do
any changes to the tracker. It is all done in the roundup python code
in templating.py.

To add the change event when updating users using the help-submit
template, copy
share/roundup/templates/devel/html/_generic.help-submit.html and
replace your tracker's html/_generic.help-submit.html.  If you have
done local changes to this file, change your file to include the code
that defines the onclick event for the input field with
id="btn_apply".

To add the change event when updating lists of issues copy
share/roundup/templates/devel/html/help_controls.js to your tracer's
html directory. If you have made local changes to the javascript file,
merge the two if/else blocks labeled::

   /* trigger change event on the field we changed */

into your help_controls.js

html/_generic.404.html in trackers use page template
----------------------------------------------------

The original generic 404 error pages for many trackers did not use the
standard page layout. This change replaces the html/_generic.404.html
page with one that uses the page template.

If your deployed tracker is based on: classic, minimal, responsive or
devel templates and has not changed the html/_generic.404.html file,
you can copy in the new file to get this additional functionality.

Organize templates into subdirectories
--------------------------------------

The @template parameter to the web interface allows the use of
subdirectories. So a setting of @template=view/view for an issue would
use the template in the tracker's html/view/issue.view.html. Similarly
for a caller class, you could put all the templates under the
html/caller directory with names like: html/caller/caller.item.html,
html/caller/caller.index.html etc. You may want to symbolically link the
html/_generic* templates into your subdirectory so that missing
templates (e.g. a missing caller.edit.html template) can be satisfied
by the _generic.edit.html template.

Properly quote query dispname (displayed name) in page.html
-----------------------------------------------------------

A new method has been added to HTMLStringProperty called url_quote.
The default templates have been updated to use this in the "Your
Query" section of the trackers html/page.html file. You will want to
change your template. Lines starting with - are the original line and
you want to change it to match the line starting with the + (remove
the + from the line)::

      <tal:block tal:repeat="qs request/user/queries">
  -    <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${qs/klass}?${qs/url}&@dispname=${qs/name}"
  +    <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${qs/klass}?${qs/url}&@dispname=${qs/name/url_quote}"
	  tal:content="qs/name">link</a><br>
      </tal:block>

Find the tal:repeat line that loops over all queries. Then
change the value assigned to @dispname in the href attribute from
${qs/name} to ${qs/name/url_quote}. Note that you should *not* change
the value for tal:content.

Allow "Show Unassigned" issues link to work for Anonymous user
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this release the anonymous user is allowed to search the user
class. The following was added to the schema for all templates that
provide the search option::

   p = db.security.addPermission(name='Search', klass='user')
   db.security.addPermissionToRole ('Anonymous', p)

If you are running a tracker that **does not** allow read access for
anonymous, you should remove this entry as it can be used to perform
a username guessing attack against a roundup install.

Errors and Troubleshooting - Unassigned issues for anonymous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you notice that the "Unassigned Issues" search on page.html
is displaying assigned issues for users with the Anonymous role,
you need to allow search permissions for the user class.

Improvements in Classic Tracker query.edit.html template
--------------------------------------------------------

There is a new query editing template included in the distribution at:

   ``share/roundup/templates/classic/html/query.edit.html``

This template fixes:

 * public query could not be removed from "Your Queries" once it was added.
   Trying to do so would cause a permissions error.
 * private yes/no dropdown always showed "yes" regardless of
   underlying state
 * query Delete button did not work.
 * same query being displayed multiple times

It also adds:
 * the table layout displays queries created by the user first,
   then available public queries.
 * public query owners are shown
 * better support for deleted queries. When a query is deleted, it is
   still available for those who added it to their query list. If you
   are the query owner, you can restore (undelete) the query. If you
   are not the owner you can remove it from your query list.
   (If a query is deleted and nobody had it in their query list, it
   will not show up in the "Active retired queries" section. You will
   have to use the class editor or roundup_admin command line to
   restore it.)
 * notifies the user that delete/restore requires javascript. It
   always did, but that requirement wasn't displayed.

To use the new template, you must add Restore permission on queries to
allow the user to restore queries (see below).

If you have not modified the query.edit.html template in your tracker,
you should be able to copy the new version from the location above.
Otherwise you will have to merge the changes into your modified template.

Add the query Restore permission for the User role to your tracker's
schema.py file.  Place it right after the query retire permission for
the user role. After the change it should look like::

  p = db.security.addPermission(name='Retire', klass='query', check=edit_query,
      description="User is allowed to retire their queries")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
  p = db.security.addPermission(name='Restore', klass='query',
      check=edit_query,
      description="User is allowed to restore their queries")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

where the last four lines are the ones you need to add.

Usually you can add this to your User role. If all users have the User
role in common then all logged in users should be ok. If you have
users who do not include the User role (e.g. they may only have a
Provisional role), you should add the search permission to that role
(e.g. Provisional) as well if you allow them to edit their list of
queries.

Also see the `new search permissions for query in 1.4.17`_ section
discussing search permission requirements for editing queries. The
fixes in this release require the ability to search the creator of all
queries to work correctly.

If the test script for the `new search permissions for query in
1.4.17`_ doesn't report that a role has the ability to search queries
or at least search the creator property for queries, add the following
permissions to your schema.py::

  s = db.security.addPermission(name='Search', klass='query',
    properties=['creator'],
    description="User is allowed to Search queries for creator")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', s)

Errors and Troubleshooting - Public queries listed twice when editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not do this, public queries will be listed twice in the edit
interface. Once in the "Queries I created" section and again in the
"Queries others created" section of the query edit page
(``http..../query?@template=edit``).

Fix security issues in query.item.html template
-----------------------------------------------
The default query.item.html template allows anybody to view all
queries.

This has been updated in the classic, devel and responsive templates
to only allow people to view queries they creates or queries that are
publicly viewable.

If you haven't modified you query.item.html template, simply copy the
query.item.html template from one of the above default templates to
your tracker's html directory.

Enhancement to check command for Permissions
--------------------------------------------

A new form of check function is permitted in permission definitions.
The three argument form is still supported and will work the same
as it always has (although it may be depricated in the future).

If the check function is defined as::

      check(db, userid, itemid, **ctx)

the ctx variable will have the context to use when determining access
rights::

     ctx['property'] the name of the property being checked or None if
            it's a class check.

     ctx['classname'] the name of the class that is being checked
            (issue, query ....).

     ctx['permission'] the name of the permission (e.g. View, Edit...).

This should make defining complex permissions much easier. Consider::

    def issue_private_access(db, userid, itemid, **ctx):
        if not db.issue.get(itemid, 'private'):
           # allow access to everything if not private	
	   return True

	# It is a private issue hide nosy list
	# Note that the nosy property *must* be listed
	# in permissions argument to the addPermission
	# definition otherwise this check command
	# is not run.
	if ctx['property'] == 'nosy':
	   return False # deny access to this property

	# allow access for editing, viewing etc. of the class
	return True


    e = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='issue',
                                  check=issue_private_access,
				  properties=['nosy'],
                                  description="Edit issue checks")

It is suggested that you change your checks to use the ``**ctx``
parameter. This is expected to be the preferred form in the future.
You do not need to use the ``ctx`` parameter in the function if you do
not need it.

Changes to property permissions
-------------------------------

If you create a permission:

    db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='user',
       properties=['theme'], check=own_record,
       description="User is allowed to view their own theme")

that combines checks and properties, the permission also matches a
permission check for the View permission on the user class.  So this
also allows the user to see their user record. It is unexpected that
checking for access without a property would match this permission.

This release adds support for making a permission like above only be
used during property permission tests. See ``customizing.txt`` and
search for props_only and set_props_only_default in the section
'Adding a new Permission'

Improve query editing
---------------------

If a user creates a query with the same name as one of their existing
queries, the query editing interface will now report an error. By
default the query editing page (issue.search.html) displays the index
page when the search is triggered. This is usually correct since the
user expects to see the results of the query. But now that
the code properly checks for duplicate search names, the user should
stay on the search page if there is an error. To add this to your
existing issue.search.html page, add the following line after the
hidden field @old-queryname:

  <input type="hidden" name="@template" value="index|search"/>

With this addition, the index template is displayed if there is no
error, and the user stays on the search template if there is an error.

New -L (loghttpvialogger) option to roundup-server
--------------------------------------------------

Http request logs from roundup-server are sent to stderr or
can be recorded in a log file (if -l or the logfile options
is used). However there is no way to rotate the logfile
without shutting down and restarting the roundup-server.

If the -L flag is used, the python logging module is used
for logging the http requests. The name for the log
(qualname) is 'roundup.http'. You can direct these messages
to a rotating log file by putting the following::

   [loggers]
   keys=roundup.http

   [logger_roundup.http]
   level=INFO
   handlers=rotate_weblog
   qualname=roundup.http
   propagate=0

   [handlers]
   keys=rotate_weblog

   [handler_rotate_weblog]
   class=logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
   args=('httpd.log','a', 512000, 2)
   formatter=plain

   [formatters]
   keys=plain

   [formatter_plain]
   format=%(message)s

into a file (e.g. logging.ini). Then reference this file in
the 'config' value of the [logging] section in the trackers
config.ini file.

Note the log configuration above is an example and can be
merged into a more full featured logging config file for
your tracker if you wish. It will create a new file in the
current working directory called 'httpd.log' and will rotate
the log file at 500K and keep two old copies of the file.

Migrating from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1
=============================

User data visibility
--------------------

For security reasons you should change the permissions on the user
class. We previously shipped a configuration that allowed users to see
too many of other users details, including hashed passwords under
certain circumstances. In schema.py in your tracker, replace the line::

   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', 'View', 'user')

with::

   p = db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='user',
       properties=('id', 'organisation', 'phone', 'realname',
       'timezone', 'username'))
   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

Note that this removes visibility of user emails, if you want emails to
be visible you can add 'address' and 'alternate_addresses' to the list
above.

XSS protection for custom actions
---------------------------------

If you have defined your own cgi actions in your tracker instance
(e.g. in a custom ``extensions/spambayes.py`` file) you need to modify
all cases where client.error_message or client.ok_message are modified
directly. Instead of::

  self.client.ok_message.append(...)

you need to call::

  self.client.add_ok_message(...)

and the same for::

  self.client.error_message.append(...)

vs.::

  self.client.add_error_message(...)

The new calls escape the passed string by default and avoid XSS security
issues.

Migrating from 1.4.20 to 1.4.21
===============================

The ``_generic.calendar.html`` page of the instance has been updated to include
``<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />``.  This prevents
robots to follow all the links in the calendar.  If you haven't modified the
page on your local instance, you can simply replace it with the one in
``share/roundup/templates/classic/html/_generic.calendar.html``; if you did,
you can add the tag manually.  See issue2550765 and changeset a099ff2ceff3.

If you are using the xml-rpc interface, there is a change
  in accessing it. You can not send text/xml data to any
  roundup url and get a response, you must use the /xmlrpc
  url. For example, if you used to send your xmlrpc request to:

   http://myroundup.com/roundup

  you need to change the url to read:

   http://myroundup.com/roundup/xmlrpc

  to invoke the xmlrpc handler. This allows us to send xml
  data to roundup for other handlers (e.g. REST, SOAP ...)
  in the future.

Migrating from 1.4.19 to 1.4.20
===============================

Roundup used to allow certain HTML-Tags in OK- and Error-messages. Since
these messages are passed via the URL (due to roundup redirecting after
an edit), we did have security-issues (see issue2550724).

If you have customized the OK or Error messages in your
roundup-installation and you were using features like bold or italic
in the message, you will have to do without this highlighting and
remove HTML tags from messages.

If you were using <br> tags for multi-line messages, you now should use
newlines instead, these will be replaced with <br/> during formatting.

Note that the previous implementation also allowed links inside
messages. Since these links could be set by an attacker, no links in
roundup messages are supported anymore. This does *not* affect the
"clear this message" link in OK-messages as it is generated by the
template and is not part of the OK-message.

If you have not modified any roundup messages, you need not do anything,
the templates shipped with roundup did not use HTML tags in messages for
highlighting.


Migrating from 1.4.17 to 1.4.18
===============================

There was a bug in 1.4.17 where files were unlinked from issues if a
mail without attachment was received via the mail interface. The
following script will list likely issues being affected by the bug.
The date in the script is the date of the 1.4.17 release. If you have
installed 1.4.17 later than this date, you can change the date
appropriately to your installation date. Run the script in the directory
of your tracker::

  #!/usr/bin/python
  import os
  from roundup import instance
  from roundup.date import Date
  dir     = os.getcwd ()
  tracker = instance.open (dir)
  db      = tracker.open ('admin')
  # you may want to change this to your install date to find less candidates
  last_release = Date('2011-05-13')
  affected = {}
  for i in db.issue.getnodeids():
      for j in db.issue.history(i):
          if i in affected:
              break
          if j[1] < last_release or j[3] != 'set' or 'files' not in j[4]:
              continue
          for op, p in j[4]['files']:
              if op == '-':
                  affected [i] = 1
                  break
  print(', '.join(sorted(affected.keys())))

To find out which files where attached before you can look in the
history of the affected issue.  For fixing issues you can re-attach the
files in question using the "set" command of roundup-admin, e.g., if the
list of files attached to an issue should be files 5, 17, 23 for issue42
you will set this using

roundup-admin -i /path/to/your/tracker set issue42 files=5,17,23

Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.17
==============================

There is a new config-option `migrate_passwords` in section `web` to
auto-migrate passwords at web-login time to a more secure storage
scheme. Default for the new option is "yes" so if you don't want that
passwords are auto-migrated to a more secure password scheme on user
login, set this to "no" before running your tracker(s) after the
upgrade.

The standalone roundup-server now defaults to listening on localhost (no
longer on all network interfaces). This will not affect you if you're
already using a configuration file for roundup-server. If you are using
an empty setting for the `host` parameter in the config-file you should
explicitly put 0.0.0.0 there as the use of an empty string to specify
listening to all interfaces is deprecated and will go away in a future
version.  If you are starting the server without a configuration file
and want to explicitly listen to all network interface, you should
specify the -n option with the address `0.0.0.0`.

.. _new search permissions for query in 1.4.17:

Searching now requires either read-permission without a check method, or
you will have to add a "Search" permission for a class or a list of
properties for a class (if you want to allow searching). For the classic
template (or other templates derived from it) you want to add the
following lines to your `schema.py` file::

  p = db.security.addPermission(name='Search', klass='query')
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

This is needed, because for the `query` class users may view only their
own queries (or public queries). This is implemented with a `check`
method, therefore the default search permissions will not allow
searching and you'll have to add an explicit search permission.
If you have modified your schema, you can check if you're missing any
search permissions with the following script, run it in your tracker
directory, it will list for each Class and Property the roles that may
search for this property::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import os
    from roundup import instance

    tracker = instance.open(os.getcwd ())
    db = tracker.open('admin')

    for cl in sorted(db.getclasses()):
        print("Class:", cl)
        for p in sorted(db.getclass(cl).getprops(protected=True).keys()):
            print("    Property:", p)
            roles = []
            for role in sorted(db.security.role.keys()):
                if db.security.roleHasSearchPermission(cl,p,role):
                    roles.append(role)
            print("        roles may search:", ', '.join(roles))


Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.12
==============================

Item creation now checks the "Create" permission instead of the "Edit"
permission for individual properties. If you have modified your tracker
permissions from the default distribution, you should check that
"Create" permissions exist for all properties you want users to be able
to create.


Fixing some potential security holes
------------------------------------

Enhanced checking was added to the user registration auditor. If you
run a public tracker you should update your tracker's
``detectors/userauditor.py`` using the new code from
``share/roundup/templates/classic/detectors/userauditor.py``. In most
cases you may just copy the file over, but if you've made changes to
the auditor in your tracker then you'll need to manually integrate
the new code.

Some HTML templates were found to have formatting security problems:

``html/page.html``::

  -tal:replace="request/user/username">username</span></b><br>
  +tal:replace="python:request.user.username.plain(escape=1)">username</span></b><br>

``html/_generic.help-list.html``::

  -tal:content="structure python:item[prop]"></label>
  +tal:content="python:item[prop]"></label>

The lines marked "+" should be added and lines marked "-" should be
deleted (minus the "+"/"-" signs).


Some HTML interface tweaks
--------------------------

You may wish to copy the ``user_utils.js`` and ``style.css` files from the
source distribution ``share/roundup/templates/classic/html/`` directory to the
``html`` directory of your trackers as it includes a small improvement.

If you have made local changes to those files you'll need to manually work
the differences in to your versions or ignore the changes.


Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.11
==============================

Close potential security hole
-----------------------------

If your tracker has untrusted users you should examine its ``schema.py``
file and look for the section granting the "Edit" permission to your users.
This should look something like::

    p = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='user', check=own_record,
        description="User is allowed to edit their own user details")

and should be modified to restrict the list of properties they are allowed
to edit by adding the ``properties=`` section like::

    p = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='user', check=own_record,
        properties=('username', 'password', 'address', 'realname', 'phone',
            'organisation', 'alternate_addresses', 'queries', 'timezone'),
        description="User is allowed to edit their own user details")

Most importantly the "roles" property should not be editable - thus not
appear in that list of properties.


Grant the "Register" permission to the Anonymous role
-----------------------------------------------------

A separate "Register" permission has been introduced to allow
anonymous users to register. This means you will need to add the
following to your tracker's ``schema.py`` to add the permission and
assign it to the Anonymous role (replacing any previously assigned
"Create user" permission for the Anonymous role)::

  +db.security.addPermission(name='Register', klass='user',
  +     description='User is allowed to register new user')

   # Assign the appropriate permissions to the anonymous user's Anonymous
   # Role. Choices here are:
   # - Allow anonymous users to register
  -db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', 'Create', 'user')
  +db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', 'Register', 'user')

The lines marked "+" should be added and lines marked "-" should be
deleted (minus the "+"/"-" signs).

You should also modify the ``html/page.html`` template to change the
permission tested there::

   -tal:condition="python:request.user.hasPermission('Create', 'user')"
   +tal:condition="python:request.user.hasPermission('Register', 'user')"


Generic class editor may now restore retired items
--------------------------------------------------

The instructions for doing so won't be present in your tracker unless you copy
the ``_generic.index.html`` template from the roundup distribution in
``share/roundup/templates/classic/html`` to your tracker's ``html`` directory.


Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.9
=============================

Customized MailGW Class
-----------------------

If you have customized the MailGW class in your tracker: The new MailGW
class opens the database for each message in the method handle_message
(instance.open) instead of passing the opened database as a parameter to
the MailGW constructor. The old handle_message has been renamed to
_handle_message. The new method opens the database and wraps the call to
the old method into a try/finally.

Your customized MailGW class needs to mirror this behavior.

Fix the "remove" button in issue files and messages lists
---------------------------------------------------------

The "remove" button(s) in the issue messages list needs to be altered. Find
the following in your tracker's ``html/issue.item.html`` template::

  <td>
   <form style="padding:0" tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
         tal:attributes="action string:issue${context/id}">
    <input type="hidden" name="@remove@files" tal:attributes="value file/id">

and add ``method="POST"`` as shown below::

  <td>
   <form style="padding:0" method="POST" tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
         tal:attributes="action string:issue${context/id}">
    <input type="hidden" name="@remove@files" tal:attributes="value file/id">

Then also find::

  <td>
   <form style="padding:0" tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
         tal:attributes="action string:issue${context/id}">
    <input type="hidden" name="@remove@messages" tal:attributes="value msg/id">

and add ``method="POST"`` as shown below::

  <td>
   <form style="padding:0" method="POST" tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
         tal:attributes="action string:issue${context/id}">
    <input type="hidden" name="@remove@messages" tal:attributes="value msg/id">


Fixing the "retire" button in user management list
--------------------------------------------------

Some previous versions of this upgrading document missed ``method="POST"``
in the change to the "retire" link in the user management list
in section `Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.7`_.
Make sure the change is done as listed below in this document.


Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.7
=============================

Several security issues were addressed in this release. Some aspects of your
trackers may no longer function depending on your local customisations. Core
functionality that will need to be modified:

Grant the "retire" permission to users for their queries
--------------------------------------------------------

Users will no longer be able to retire their own queries. To remedy this you
will need to add the following to your tracker's ``schema.py`` just under the
line that grants them permission to edit their own queries::

   p = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='query', check=edit_query,
      description="User is allowed to edit their queries")
   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
 + p = db.security.addPermission(name='Retire', klass='query', check=edit_query,
 +    description="User is allowed to retire their queries")
 + db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
   p = db.security.addPermission(name='Create', klass='query',
      description="User is allowed to create queries")
   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

The lines marked "+" should be added, minus the "+" sign.


Fix the "retire" link in the users list for admin users
-------------------------------------------------------

The "retire" link found in the file ``html/user.index.html``::

  <td tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok">
   <a tal:attributes="href string:user${user/id}?@action=retire&@template=index"
    i18n:translate="">retire</a>

Should be replaced with::

  <td tal:condition="context/is_retire_ok">
     <form style="padding:0" method="POST"
           tal:attributes="action string:user${user/id}">
      <input type="hidden" name="@template" value="index">
      <input type="hidden" name="@action" value="retire">
      <input type="submit" value="retire" i18n:attributes="value">
     </form>


Fix for Python 2.6+ users
-------------------------

If you use Python 2.6 you should edit your tracker's
``detectors/nosyreaction.py`` file to change::

   import sets

at the top to::

   from roundup.anypy.sets_ import set

and then all instances of ``sets.Set()`` to ``set()`` in the later code.



Trackers currently allowing HTML file uploading
-----------------------------------------------

Trackers which wish to continue to allow uploading of HTML content against issues
will need to set a new configuration variable in the ``[web]`` section of the
tracker's ``config.ini`` file:

   # Setting this option enables Roundup to serve uploaded HTML
   # file content *as HTML*. This is a potential security risk
   # and is therefore disabled by default. Set to 'yes' if you
   # trust *all* users uploading content to your tracker.
   # Allowed values: yes, no
   # Default: no
   allow_html_file = no



Migrating from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3
=============================

If you are using the MySQL backend you will need to replace some indexes
that may have been created by version 1.4.2.

You should to access your MySQL database directly and remove any indexes
with a name ending in "_key_retired_idx". You should then re-add them with
the same spec except the key column name needs a size. So an index on
"_user (__retired, _name)" should become "_user (__retired, _name(255))".


Migrating from 1.4.x to 1.4.2
=============================

You should run the "roundup-admin migrate" command for your tracker once
you've installed the latest codebase.

Do this before you use the web, command-line or mail interface and before
any users access the tracker.

This command will respond with either "Tracker updated" (if you've not
previously run it on an RDBMS backend) or "No migration action required"
(if you have run it, or have used another interface to the tracker,
or are using anydbm).

It's safe to run this even if it's not required, so just get into the
habit.


Migrating from 1.3.3 to 1.4.0
=============================

Value of the "refwd_re" tracker configuration option (section "mailgw")
is treated as UTF-8 string.  In previous versions, it was ISO8859-1.

If you have running trackers based on the classic template, please
update the messagesummary detector as follows::

    --- detectors/messagesummary.py 17 Apr 2003 03:26:38 -0000      1.1
    +++ detectors/messagesummary.py 3 Apr 2007 06:47:21 -0000       1.2
    @@ -8,7 +8,7 @@
     if newvalues.has_key('summary') or not newvalues.has_key('content'):
         return

    -    summary, content = parseContent(newvalues['content'], 1, 1)
    +    summary, content = parseContent(newvalues['content'], config=db.config)
     newvalues['summary'] = summary

In the latest version we have added some database indexes to the
SQL-backends (mysql, postgresql, sqlite) for speeding up building the
roundup-index for full-text search. We recommend that you create the
following database indexes on the database by hand::

 CREATE INDEX words_by_id ON __words (_textid);
 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX __textids_by_props ON __textids (_class, _itemid, _prop);

Migrating from 1.2.x to 1.3.0
=============================

1.3.0 Web interface changes
---------------------------

Some of the HTML files in the "classic" and "minimal" tracker templates
were changed to fix some bugs and clean them up. You may wish to compare
them to the HTML files in your tracker and apply any changes.


Migrating from 1.1.2 to 1.2.0
=============================

1.2.0 Sorting and grouping by multiple properties
-------------------------------------------------

Starting with this version, sorting and grouping by multiple properties
is possible. This means that request.sort and request.group are now
lists. This is reflected in several places:

 * ``renderWith`` now has list attributes for ``sort`` and ``group``,
   where you previously wrote::

    renderWith(... sort=('-', 'activity'), group=('+', 'priority')

   you write now::

    renderWith(... sort=[('-', 'activity')], group=[('+', 'priority')]

 * In templates that permit to edit sorting/grouping, request.sort and
   request.group are (possibly empty) lists. You can now sort and group
   by multiple attributes. For an example, see the classic template. You
   may want search for the variable ``n_sort`` which can be set to the
   number of sort/group properties.

 * Templates that diplay new headlines for each group of items with
   equal group properties can now use the modified ``batch.propchanged``
   method that can take several properties which are checked for
   changes. See the example in the classic template which makes use of
   ``batch.propchanged``.

Migrating from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
=============================

1.1.1 "Clear this message"
--------------------------

In 1.1.1, the standard ``page.html`` template includes a "clear this message"
link in the green "ok" message bar that appears after a successful edit
(or other) action.

To include this in your tracker, change the following in your ``page.html``
template::

 <p tal:condition="options/ok_message | nothing" class="ok-message"
    tal:repeat="m options/ok_message" tal:content="structure m">error</p>

to be::

 <p tal:condition="options/ok_message | nothing" class="ok-message">
   <span tal:repeat="m options/ok_message"
      tal:content="structure string:$m <br/ > " />
    <a class="form-small" tal:attributes="href request/current_url"
       i18n:translate="">clear this message</a>
 </p>


If you implemented the "clear this message" in your 1.1.0 tracker, then you
should change it to the above and it will work much better!


Migrating from 1.0.x to 1.1.0
=============================

1.1 Login "For Session Only"
----------------------------

In 1.1, web logins are alive for the length of a session only, *unless* you
add the following to the login form in your tracker's ``page.html``::

    <input type="checkbox" name="remember" id="remember">
    <label for="remember" i18n:translate="">Remember me?</label><br>

See the classic tracker ``page.html`` if you're unsure where this should
go.


1.1 Query Display Name
----------------------

The ``dispname`` web variable has been renamed ``@dispname`` to avoid
clashing with other variables of the same name. If you are using the
display name feature, you will need to edit your tracker's ``page.html``
and ``issue.index.html`` pages to change ``dispname`` to ``@dispname``.

A side-effect of this change is that the renderWith method used in the
``home.html`` page may now take a dispname argument.


1.1 "Clear this message"
------------------------

In 1.1, the standard ``page.html`` template includes a "clear this message"
link in the green "ok" message bar that appears after a successful edit
(or other) action.

To include this in your tracker, change the following in your ``page.html``
template::

 <p tal:condition="options/ok_message | nothing" class="ok-message"
    tal:repeat="m options/ok_message" tal:content="structure m">error</p>

to be::

 <p tal:condition="options/ok_message | nothing" class="ok-message">
   <span tal:repeat="m options/ok_message"
      tal:content="structure string:$m <br/ > " />
    <a class="form-small" tal:attributes="href string:issue${context/id}"
       i18n:translate="">clear this message</a>
 </p>


Migrating from 0.8.x to 1.0
===========================

1.0 New Query Permissions
-------------------------

New permissions are defined for query editing and viewing. To include these
in your tracker, you need to add these lines to your tracker's
``schema.py``::

 # Users should be able to edit and view their own queries. They should also
 # be able to view any marked as not private. They should not be able to
 # edit others' queries, even if they're not private
 def view_query(db, userid, itemid):
     private_for = db.query.get(itemid, 'private_for')
     if not private_for: return True
     return userid == private_for
 def edit_query(db, userid, itemid):
     return userid == db.query.get(itemid, 'creator')
 p = db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='query', check=view_query,
     description="User is allowed to view their own and public queries")
 db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
 p = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='query', check=edit_query,
     description="User is allowed to edit their queries")
 db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
 p = db.security.addPermission(name='Create', klass='query',
     description="User is allowed to create queries")
 db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

and then remove 'query' from the line::

 # Assign the access and edit Permissions for issue, file and message
 # to regular users now
 for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'query', 'keyword':

so it looks like::

 for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'keyword':


Migrating from 0.8.0 to 0.8.3
=============================

0.8.3 Nosy Handling Changes
---------------------------

A change was made to fix a bug in the ``nosyreaction.py`` standard
detector. To incorporate this fix in your trackers, you will need to copy
the ``nosyreaction.py`` file from the ``templates/classic/detectors``
directory of the source to your tracker's ``templates`` directory.

If you have modified the ``nosyreaction.py`` file from the standard
version, you will need to roll your changes into the new file.


Migrating from 0.7.1 to 0.8.0
=============================

You *must* fully uninstall previous Roundup version before installing
Roundup 0.8.0.  If you don't do that, ``roundup-admin install``
command may fail to function properly.

0.8.0 Backend changes
---------------------

Backends 'bsddb' and 'bsddb3' are removed.  If you are using one of these,
you *must* migrate to another backend before upgrading.


0.8.0 API changes
-----------------

Class.safeget() was removed from the API. Test your item ids before calling
Class.get() instead.


0.8.0 New tracker layout
------------------------

The ``config.py`` file has been replaced by ``config.ini``. You may use the
roundup-admin command "genconfig" to generate a new config file::

  roundup-admin genconfig <tracker home>/config.ini

and modify the values therein based on the contents of your old config.py.
In most cases, the names of the config variables are the same.

The ``select_db.py`` file has been replaced by a file in the ``db``
directory called ``backend_name``. As you might guess, this file contains
just the name of the backend. To figure what the contents of yours should
be, use the following table:

  ================================ =========================
  ``select_db.py`` contents        ``backend_name`` contents
  ================================ =========================
  from back_anydbm import ...      anydbm
  from back_metakit import ...     metakit
  from back_sqlite import ...      sqlite
  from back_mysql import ...       mysql
  from back_postgresql import ...  postgresql
  ================================ =========================

The ``dbinit.py`` file has been split into two new files,
``initial_data.py`` and ``schema.py``. The contents of this file are:

``initial_data.py``
  You don't need one of these as your tracker is already initialised.

``schema.py``
  Copy the body of the ``def open(name=None)`` function from your old
  tracker's ``dbinit.py`` file to this file. As the lines you're copying
  aren't part of a function definition anymore, one level of indentation
  needs to be removed (remove only the leading four spaces on each
  line).

  The first few lines -- those starting with ``from roundup.hyperdb
  import ...`` and the ``db = Database(config, name)`` line -- don't
  need to be copied. Neither do the last few lines -- those starting
  with ``import detectors``, down to ``return db`` inclusive.

You may remove the ``__init__.py`` module from the "detectors" directory as
it is no longer used.

There's a new way to write extension code for Roundup. If you have code in
an ``interfaces.py`` file you should move it. See the `customisation
documentation`_ for information about how extensions are now written.
Note that some older trackers may use ``interfaces.py`` to customise the
mail gateway behaviour. You will need to keep your ``interfaces.py`` file
if this is the case.


0.8.0 Permissions Changes
-------------------------

The creation of a new item in the user interfaces is now controlled by the
"Create" Permission. You will need to add an assignment of this Permission
to your users who are allowed to create items. The most common form of this
is the following in your ``schema.py`` added just under the current
assignation of the Edit Permission::

    for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'query', 'keyword':
        p = db.security.getPermission('Create', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

You will need to explicitly let anonymous users access the web interface so
that regular users are able to see the login form. Note that almost all
trackers will need this Permission. The only situation where it's not
required is in a tracker that uses an HTTP Basic Authenticated front-end.
It's enabled by adding to your ``schema.py``::

    p = db.security.getPermission('Web Access')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)

Finally, you will need to enable permission for your users to edit their
own details by adding the following to ``schema.py``::

    # Users should be able to edit their own details. Note that this
    # permission is limited to only the situation where the Viewed or
    # Edited item is their own.
    def own_record(db, userid, itemid):
        '''Determine whether the userid matches the item being accessed.'''
        return userid == itemid
    p = db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='user', check=own_record,
        description="User is allowed to view their own user details")
    p = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='user', check=own_record,
        description="User is allowed to edit their own user details")
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)


0.8.0 Use of TemplatingUtils
----------------------------

If you used custom python functions in TemplatingUtils, they must
be moved from interfaces.py to a new file in the ``extensions`` directory.

Each Function that should be available through TAL needs to be defined
as a toplevel function in the newly created file. Furthermore you
add an inititialization function, that registers the functions with the
tracker.

If you find this too tedious, donfu wrote an automatic init function that
takes an existing TemplatingUtils class, and registers all class methods
that do not start with an underscore. The following hack should be placed
in the ``extensions`` directory alongside other extensions::

    class TemplatingUtils:
         # copy from interfaces.py

    def init(tracker):
         util = TemplatingUtils()

         def setClient(tu):
             util.client = tu.client
             return util

         def execUtil(name):
             return lambda tu, *args, **kwargs: \
                     getattr(setClient(tu), name)(*args, **kwargs)

         for name in dir(util):
             if callable(getattr(util, name)) and not name.startswith('_'):
                  tracker.registerUtil(name, execUtil(name))


0.8.0 Logging Configuration
---------------------------

See the `administration guide`_ for information about configuring the new
logging implemented in 0.8.0.


Migrating from 0.7.2 to 0.7.3
=============================

0.7.3 Configuration
-------------------

If you choose, you may specify the directory from which static files are
served (those which use the URL component ``@@file``). Currently the
directory defaults to the ``TEMPLATES`` configuration variable. You may
define a new variable, ``STATIC_FILES`` which overrides this value for
static files.


Migrating from 0.7.0 to 0.7.2
=============================

0.7.2 DEFAULT_TIMEZONE is now required
--------------------------------------

The DEFAULT_TIMEZONE configuration variable is now required. Add the
following to your tracker's ``config.py`` file::

    # You may specify a different default timezone, for use when users do not
    # choose their own in their settings.
    DEFAULT_TIMEZONE = 0            # specify as numeric hour offest


Migrating from 0.7.0 to 0.7.1
=============================

0.7.1 Permission assignments
----------------------------

If you allow anonymous access to your tracker, you might need to assign
some additional View (or Edit if your tracker is that open) permissions
to the "anonymous" user. To do so, find the code in your ``dbinit.py`` that
says::

    for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'query', 'keyword':
        p = db.security.getPermission('View', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
        p = db.security.getPermission('Edit', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
    for cl in 'priority', 'status':
        p = db.security.getPermission('View', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

Add add a line::

        db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)

next to the existing ``'User'`` lines for the Permissions you wish to
assign to the anonymous user.


Migrating from 0.6 to 0.7
=========================

0.7.0 Permission assignments
----------------------------

Due to a change in the rendering of web widgets, permissions are now
checked on Classes where they previously weren't (this is a good thing).

You will need to add some additional Permission assignments for your
regular users, or some displays will break. After the following in your
tracker's ``dbinit.py``::

    # Assign the access and edit Permissions for issue, file and message
    # to regular users now
    for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'query', 'keyword':
        p = db.security.getPermission('View', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
        p = db.security.getPermission('Edit', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

add::

    for cl in 'priority', 'status':
        p = db.security.getPermission('View', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)


0.7.0 Getting the current user id
---------------------------------

The Database.curuserid attribute has been removed.

Any code referencing this attribute should be replaced with a
call to Database.getuid().


0.7.0 ZRoundup changes
----------------------

The templates in your tracker's html directory will need updating if you
wish to use ZRoundup. If you've not modified those files (or some of them),
you may just copy the new versions from the Roundup source in the
templates/classic/html directory.

If you have modified the html files, then you'll need to manually edit them
to change all occurances of special form variables from using the colon ":"
special character to the at "@" special character. That is, variables such
as::

  :action :required :template :remove:messages ...

should become::

  @action @required @template @remove@messages ...

Note that ``tal:`` statements are unaffected. So are TAL expression type
prefixes such as ``python:`` and ``string:``. Please ask on the
roundup-users mailing list for help if you're unsure.


0.7.0 Edit collision detection
------------------------------

Roundup now detects collisions with editing in the web interface (that is,
two people editing the same item at the same time).

You must copy the ``_generic.collision.html`` file from Roundup source in
the ``templates/classic/html`` directory. to your tracker's ``html``
directory.


Migrating from 0.6.x to 0.6.3
=============================

0.6.3 Configuration
-------------------

You will need to copy the file::

  templates/classic/detectors/__init__.py

to your tracker's ``detectors`` directory, replacing the one already there.
This fixes a couple of bugs in that file.



Migrating from 0.5 to 0.6
=========================


0.6.0 Configuration
-------------------

Introduced EMAIL_FROM_TAG config variable. This value is inserted into
the From: line of nosy email. If the sending user is "Foo Bar", the
From: line is usually::

     "Foo Bar" <issue_tracker@tracker.example>

the EMAIL_FROM_TAG goes inside the "Foo Bar" quotes like so::

     "Foo Bar EMAIL_FROM_TAG" <issue_tracker@tracker.example>

I've altered the mechanism in the detectors __init__.py module so that it
doesn't cross-import detectors from other trackers (if you run more than one
in a single roundup-server). This change means that you'll need to copy the
__init__.py from roundup/templates/classic/detectors/__init__.py to your
<tracker home>/detectors/__init__.py. Don't worry, the "classic" __init__ is a
one-size-fits-all, so it'll work even if you've added/removed detectors.

0.6.0 Templating changes
------------------------

The ``user.item`` template (in the tracker home "templates" directory)
needs to have the following hidden variable added to its form (between the
``<form...>`` and ``</form>`` tags::

  <input type="hidden" name=":template" value="item">


0.6.0 Form handling changes
---------------------------

Roundup's form handling capabilities have been significantly expanded. This
should not affect users of 0.5 installations - but if you find you're
getting errors from form submissions, please ask for help on the Roundup
users mailing list:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/roundup/lists/roundup-users

See the customisation doc section on `Form Values`__ for documentation of the
new form variables possible.

__ customizing.html#form-values


0.6.0 Multilingual character set support
----------------------------------------

Added internationalization support. This is done via encoding all data
stored in roundup database to utf-8 (unicode encoding). To support utf-8 in
web interface you should add the folowing line to your tracker's html/page
and html/_generic.help files inside <head> tag::

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

Since latin characters in utf-8 have the same codes as in ASCII table, this
modification is optional for users who use only plain latin characters.

After this modification, you will be able to see and enter any world
character via web interface. Data received via mail interface also converted
to utf-8, however only new messages will be converted. If your roundup
database contains some of non-ASCII characters in one of 8-bit encoding,
they will not be visible in new unicode environment. Some of such data (e.g.
user names, keywords, etc)  can be edited by administrator, the others
(e.g. messages' contents) is not editable via web interface. Currently there
is no tool for converting such data, the only solution is to close
appropriate old issues and create new ones with the same content.


0.6.0 User timezone support
---------------------------

From version 0.6.0 roundup supports displaying of Date data in user' local
timezone if he/she has provided timezone information. To make it possible
some modification to tracker's schema and HTML templates are required.
First you must add string property 'timezone' to user class in dbinit.py
like this::

    user = Class(db, "user",
                    username=String(),   password=Password(),
                    address=String(),    realname=String(),
                    phone=String(),      organisation=String(),
                    alternate_addresses=String(),
                    queries=Multilink('query'), roles=String(),
                    timezone=String())

And second - html interface. Add following lines to
$TRACKER_HOME/html/user.item template::

     <tr>
      <th>Timezone</th>
      <td tal:content="structure context/timezone/field">timezone</td>
     </tr>

After that all users should be able to provide their timezone information.
Timezone should be a positive or negative integer - offset from GMT.

After providing timezone, roundup will show all dates values, found in web
and mail interfaces in local time. It will also accept any Date info in
local time, convert and store it in GMT.


0.6.0 Search page structure
---------------------------

In order to accomodate query editing the search page has been restructured. If
you want to provide your users with query editing, you should update your
search page using the macros detailed in the customisation doc section
`Searching on categories`__.

__ customizing.html#searching-on-categories

Also, the url field in the query class no longer starts with a '?'. You'll need
to remove this question mark from the url field to support queries. There's
a script in the "tools" directory called ``migrate-queries.py`` that should
automatically change any existing queries for you. As always, make a backup
of your database before running such a script.


0.6.0 Notes for metakit backend users
-------------------------------------

Roundup 0.6.0 introduced searching on ranges of dates and intervals. To
support it, some modifications to interval storing routine were made. So if
your tracker uses metakit backend and your db schema contains intervals
property, searches on that property will not be accurate for db items that
was stored before roundup' upgrade. However all new records should be
searchable on intervals.

It is possible to convert your database to new format: you can export and
import back all your data (consult "Migrating backends" in "Maintenance"
documentation). After this operation all your interval properties should
become searchable.

Users of backends others than metakit should not worry about this issue.


Migrating from 0.4.x to 0.5.0
=============================

This has been a fairly major revision of Roundup:

1. Brand new, much more powerful, flexible, tasty and nutritious templating.
   Unfortunately, this means all your current templates are useless. Hopefully
   the new documentation and examples will be enough to help you make the
   transition. Please don't hesitate to ask on roundup-users for help (or
   complete conversions if you're completely stuck)!
2. The database backed got a lot more flexible, allowing Metakit and SQL
   databases! The only decent SQL database implemented at present is sqlite,
   but others shouldn't be a whole lot more work.
3. A brand new, highly flexible and much more robust security system including
   a system of Permissions, Roles and Role assignments to users. You may now
   define your own Permissions that may be checked in CGI transactions.
4. Journalling has been made less storage-hungry, so has been turned on
   by default *except* for author, recipient and nosy link/unlink events. You
   are advised to turn it off in your trackers too.
5. We've changed the terminology from "instance" to "tracker", to ease the
   learning curve/impact for new users.
6. Because of the above changes, the tracker configuration has seen some
   major changes. See below for the details.

Please, **back up your database** before you start the migration process. This
is as simple as copying the "db" directory and all its contents from your
tracker to somewhere safe.


0.5.0 Configuration
-------------------

First up, rename your ``instance_config.py`` file to just ``config.py``.

Then edit your tracker's ``__init__.py`` module. It'll currently look
like this::

 from instance_config import *
 try:
     from dbinit import *
 except ImportError:
     pass # in installdir (probably :)
 from interfaces import *

and it needs to be::

 import config
 from dbinit import open, init
 from interfaces import Client, MailGW

Due to the new templating having a top-level ``page`` that defines links for
searching, indexes, adding items etc, the following variables are no longer
used:

- HEADER_INDEX_LINKS
- HEADER_ADD_LINKS
- HEADER_SEARCH_LINKS
- SEARCH_FILTERS
- DEFAULT_INDEX
- UNASSIGNED_INDEX
- USER_INDEX
- ISSUE_FILTER

The new security implementation will require additions to the dbinit module,
but also removes the need for the following tracker config variables:

- ANONYMOUS_ACCESS
- ANONYMOUS_REGISTER

but requires two new variables which define the Roles assigned to users who
register through the web and e-mail interfaces:

- NEW_WEB_USER_ROLES
- NEW_EMAIL_USER_ROLES

in both cases, 'User' is a good initial setting. To emulate
``ANONYMOUS_ACCESS='deny'``, remove all "View" Permissions from the
"Anonymous" Role. To emulate ``ANONYMOUS_REGISTER='deny'``, remove the "Web
Registration" and/or the "Email Registration" Permission from the "Anonymous"
Role. See the section on customising security in the `customisation
documentation`_ for more information.

Finally, the following config variables have been renamed to make more sense:

- INSTANCE_HOME -> TRACKER_HOME
- INSTANCE_NAME -> TRACKER_NAME
- ISSUE_TRACKER_WEB -> TRACKER_WEB
- ISSUE_TRACKER_EMAIL -> TRACKER_EMAIL


0.5.0 Schema Specification
--------------------------

0.5.0 Database backend changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your select_db module in your tracker has changed a fair bit. Where it used
to contain::

 # WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!
 from roundup.backends.back_anydbm import Database

it must now contain::

 # WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!
 from roundup.backends.back_anydbm import Database, Class, FileClass, IssueClass

Yes, I realise the irony of the "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" statement :)
Note the addition of the Class, FileClass, IssueClass imports. These are very
important, as they're going to make the next change work too. You now need to
modify the top of the dbinit module in your tracker from::

 import instance_config
 from roundup import roundupdb
 from select_db import Database

 from roundup.roundupdb import Class, FileClass

 class Database(roundupdb.Database, select_db.Database):
     ''' Creates a hybrid database from:
          . the selected database back-end from select_db
          . the roundup extensions from roundupdb
     '''
     pass

 class IssueClass(roundupdb.IssueClass):
     ''' issues need the email information
     '''
     pass

to::

 import config
 from select_db import Database, Class, FileClass, IssueClass

Yes, remove the Database and IssueClass definitions and those other imports.
They're not needed any more!

Look for places in dbinit.py where ``instance_config`` is used too, and
rename them ``config``.


0.5.0 Journalling changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journalling has been optimised for storage. Journalling of links has been
turned back on by default. If your tracker has a large user base, you may wish
to turn off journalling of nosy list, message author and message recipient
link and unlink events. You do this by adding ``do_journal='no'`` to the Class
initialisation in your dbinit. For example, your *msg* class initialisation
probably looks like this::

    msg = FileClass(db, "msg",
                    author=Link("user"), recipients=Multilink("user"),
                    date=Date(),         summary=String(),
                    files=Multilink("file"),
                    messageid=String(),  inreplyto=String())

to turn off journalling of author and recipient link events, add
``do_journal='no'`` to the ``author=Link("user")`` part of the statement,
like so::

    msg = FileClass(db, "msg",
                    author=Link("user", do_journal='no'),
                    recipients=Multilink("user", do_journal='no'),
                    date=Date(),         summary=String(),
                    files=Multilink("file"),
                    messageid=String(),  inreplyto=String())

Nosy list link event journalling is actually turned off by default now. If you
want to turn it on, change to your issue class' nosy list, change its
definition from::

    issue = IssueClass(db, "issue",
                    assignedto=Link("user"), topic=Multilink("keyword"),
                    priority=Link("priority"), status=Link("status"))

to::

    issue = IssueClass(db, "issue", nosy=Multilink("user", do_journal='yes'),
                    assignedto=Link("user"), topic=Multilink("keyword"),
                    priority=Link("priority"), status=Link("status"))

noting that your definition of the nosy Multilink will override the normal one.


0.5.0 User schema changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users have two more properties, "queries" and "roles". You'll have something
like this in your dbinit module now::

    user = Class(db, "user",
                    username=String(),   password=Password(),
                    address=String(),    realname=String(),
                    phone=String(),      organisation=String(),
                    alternate_addresses=String())
    user.setkey("username")

and you'll need to add the new properties and the new "query" class to it
like so::

    query = Class(db, "query",
                    klass=String(),     name=String(),
                    url=String())
    query.setkey("name")

    # Note: roles is a comma-separated string of Role names
    user = Class(db, "user",
                    username=String(),   password=Password(),
                    address=String(),    realname=String(),
                    phone=String(),      organisation=String(),
                    alternate_addresses=String(),
                    queries=Multilink('query'), roles=String())
    user.setkey("username")

The "queries" property is used to store off the user's favourite database
queries. The "roles" property is explained below in `0.5.0 Security
Settings`_.


0.5.0 Security Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `security documentation`_ for an explanation of how the new security
system works. In a nutshell though, the security is handled as a four step
process:

1. Permissions are defined as having a name and optionally a hyperdb class
   they're specific to,
2. Roles are defined that have one or more Permissions,
3. Users are assigned Roles in their "roles" property, and finally
4. Roundup checks that users have appropriate Permissions at appropriate times
   (like editing issues).

Your tracker dbinit module's *open* function now has to define any
Permissions that are specific to your tracker, and also the assignment
of Permissions to Roles. At the moment, your open function
ends with::

    import detectors
    detectors.init(db)

    return db

and what we need to do is insert some commands that will set up the security
parameters. Right above the ``import detectors`` line, you'll want to insert
these lines::

    #
    # SECURITY SETTINGS
    #
    # new permissions for this schema
    for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg', 'user':
        db.security.addPermission(name="Edit", klass=cl,
            description="User is allowed to edit "+cl)
        db.security.addPermission(name="View", klass=cl,
            description="User is allowed to access "+cl)

    # Assign the access and edit permissions for issue, file and message
    # to regular users now
    for cl in 'issue', 'file', 'msg':
        p = db.security.getPermission('View', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
        p = db.security.getPermission('Edit', cl)
        db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
    # and give the regular users access to the web and email interface
    p = db.security.getPermission('Web Access')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
    p = db.security.getPermission('Email Access')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

    # May users view other user information? Comment these lines out
    # if you don't want them to
    p = db.security.getPermission('View', 'user')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

    # Assign the appropriate permissions to the anonymous user's Anonymous
    # Role. Choices here are:
    # - Allow anonymous users to register through the web
    p = db.security.getPermission('Web Registration')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)
    # - Allow anonymous (new) users to register through the email gateway
    p = db.security.getPermission('Email Registration')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)
    # - Allow anonymous users access to the "issue" class of data
    #   Note: this also grants access to related information like files,
    #         messages, statuses etc that are linked to issues
    #p = db.security.getPermission('View', 'issue')
    #db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)
    # - Allow anonymous users access to edit the "issue" class of data
    #   Note: this also grants access to create related information like
    #         files and messages etc that are linked to issues
    #p = db.security.getPermission('Edit', 'issue')
    #db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)

    # oh, g'wan, let anonymous access the web interface too
    p = db.security.getPermission('Web Access')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', p)

Note in the comments there the places where you might change the permissions
to restrict users or grant users more access. If you've created additional
classes that users should be able to edit and view, then you should add them
to the "new permissions for this schema" section at the start of the security
block. Then add them to the "Assign the access and edit permissions" section
too, so people actually have the new Permission you've created.

One final change is needed that finishes off the security system's
initialisation. We need to add a call to ``db.post_init()`` at the end of the
dbinit open() function. Add it like this::

    import detectors
    detectors.init(db)

    # schema is set up - run any post-initialisation
    db.post_init()
    return db

You may verify the setup of Permissions and Roles using the new
"``roundup-admin security``" command.


0.5.0 User changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support all those schema changes, you'll need to massage your user database
a little too, to:

1. make sure there's an "anonymous" user - this user is mandatory now and is
   the one that unknown users are logged in as.
2. make sure all users have at least one Role.

If you don't have the "anonymous" user, create it now with the command::

  roundup-admin create user username=anonymous roles=Anonymous

making sure the capitalisation is the same as above. Once you've done that,
you'll need to set the roles property on all users to a reasonable default.
The admin user should get "Admin", the anonymous user "Anonymous"
and all other users "User". The ``fixroles.py`` script in the tools directory
will do this. Run it like so (where python is your python 2+ binary)::

  python tools/fixroles.py -i <tracker home> fixroles



0.5.0 CGI interface changes
---------------------------

The CGI interface code was completely reorganised and largely rewritten. The
end result is that this section of your tracker interfaces module will need
changing from::

 from roundup import cgi_client, mailgw
 from roundup.i18n import _

 class Client(cgi_client.Client):
     ''' derives basic CGI implementation from the standard module,
         with any specific extensions
     '''
     pass

to::

 from roundup import mailgw
 from roundup.cgi import client

 class Client(client.Client):
     ''' derives basic CGI implementation from the standard module,
         with any specific extensions
     '''
     pass

You will also need to install the new version of roundup.cgi from the source
cgi-bin directory if you're using it.


0.5.0 HTML templating
---------------------

You'll want to make a backup of your current tracker html directory. You
should then copy the html directory from the Roundup source "classic" template
and modify it according to your local schema changes.

If you need help with the new templating system, please ask questions on the
roundup-users mailing list (available through the roundup web page on
sourceforge, http://www.roundup-tracker.org/.


0.5.0 Detectors
---------------

The nosy reactor has been updated to handle the tracker not having an
"assignedto" property on issues. You may want to copy it into your tracker's
detectors directory. Chances are you've already fixed it though :)


Migrating from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
=============================

0.4.2 Configuration
-------------------
The USER_INDEX definition introduced in 0.4.1 was too restrictive in its
allowing replacement of 'assignedto' with the user's userid. Users must change
the None value of 'assignedto' to 'CURRENT USER' (the string, in quotes) for
the replacement behaviour to occur now.

The new configuration variables are:

- EMAIL_KEEP_QUOTED_TEXT
- EMAIL_LEAVE_BODY_UNCHANGED
- ADD_RECIPIENTS_TO_NOSY

See the sample configuration files in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/instance_config.py

and::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/instance_config.py

and the `customisation documentation`_ for information on how they're used.


0.4.2 Changes to detectors
--------------------------
You will need to copy the detectors from the distribution into your instance
home "detectors" directory. If you used the classic schema, the detectors
are in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/detectors/

If you used the extended schema, the detectors are in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/detectors/

The change means that schema-specific code has been removed from the
mail gateway and cgi interface and made into auditors:

- nosyreactor.py has now got an updatenosy auditor which updates the nosy
  list with author, recipient and assignedto information.
- statusauditor.py makes the unread or resolved -> chatting changes and
  presets the status of an issue to unread.

There's also a bug or two fixed in the nosyreactor code.

0.4.2 HTML templating changes
-----------------------------
The link() htmltemplate function now has a "showid" option for links and
multilinks. When true, it only displays the linked item id as the anchor
text. The link value is displayed as a tooltip using the title anchor
attribute. To use in eg. the superseder field, have something like this::

   <td>
    <display call="field('superseder', showid=1)">
    <display call="classhelp('issue', 'id,title', label='list', width=500)">
    <property name="superseder">
     <br>View: <display call="link('superseder', showid=1)">
    </property>
   </td>

The stylesheets have been cleaned up too. You may want to use the newer
versions in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/<template>/html/default.css



Migrating from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1
=============================

0.4.1 Files storage
-------------------

Messages and files from newly created issues will be put into subdierectories
in thousands e.g. msg123 will be put into files/msg/0/msg123, file2003
will go into files/file/2/file2003. Previous messages are still found, but
could be put into this structure.

0.4.1 Configuration
-------------------

To allow more fine-grained access control, the variable used to check
permission to auto-register users in the mail gateway is now called
ANONYMOUS_REGISTER_MAIL rather than overloading ANONYMOUS_REGISTER. If the
variable doesn't exist, then ANONYMOUS_REGISTER is tested as before.

Configuring the links in the web header is now easier too. The following
variables have been added to the classic instance_config.py::

  HEADER_INDEX_LINKS   - defines the "index" links to be made available
  HEADER_ADD_LINKS     - defines the "add" links
  DEFAULT_INDEX        - specifies the index view for DEFAULT
  UNASSIGNED_INDEX     - specifies the index view for UNASSIGNED
  USER_INDEX           - specifies the index view for USER

See the <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/instance_config.py for more
information - including how the variables are to be set up. Most users will
just be able to copy the variables from the source to their instance home. If
you've modified the header by changing the source of the interfaces.py file in
the instance home, you'll need to remove that customisation and move it into
the appropriate variables in instance_config.py.

The extended schema has similar variables added too - see the source for more
info.

0.4.1 Alternate E-Mail Addresses
--------------------------------

If you add the property "alternate_addresses" to your user class, your users
will be able to register alternate email addresses that they may use to
communicate with roundup as. All email from roundup will continue to be sent
to their primary address.

If you have not edited the dbinit.py file in your instance home directory,
you may simply copy the new dbinit.py file from the core code. If you used
the classic schema, the interfaces file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/dbinit.py

If you used the extended schema, the file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/dbinit.py

If you have modified your dbinit.py file, you need to edit the dbinit.py
file in your instance home directory. Find the lines which define the user
class::

    user = Class(db, "msg",
                    username=String(),   password=Password(),
                    address=String(),    realname=String(),
                    phone=String(),      organisation=String(),
                    alternate_addresses=String())

You will also want to add the property to the user's details page. The
template for this is the "user.item" file in your instance home "html"
directory. Similar to above, you may copy the file from the roundup source if
you haven't modified it. Otherwise, add the following to the template::

   <display call="multiline('alternate_addresses')">

with appropriate labelling etc. See the standard template for an idea.



Migrating from 0.3.x to 0.4.0
=============================

0.4.0 Message-ID and In-Reply-To addition
-----------------------------------------
0.4.0 adds the tracking of messages by message-id and allows threading
using in-reply-to. Most e-mail clients support threading using this
feature, and we hope to add support for it to the web gateway. If you
have not edited the dbinit.py file in your instance home directory, you may
simply copy the new dbinit.py file from the core code. If you used the
classic schema, the interfaces file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/dbinit.py

If you used the extended schema, the file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/dbinit.py

If you have modified your dbinit.py file, you need to edit the dbinit.py
file in your instance home directory. Find the lines which define the msg
class::

    msg = FileClass(db, "msg",
                    author=Link("user"), recipients=Multilink("user"),
                    date=Date(),         summary=String(),
                    files=Multilink("file"))

and add the messageid and inreplyto properties like so::

    msg = FileClass(db, "msg",
                    author=Link("user"), recipients=Multilink("user"),
                    date=Date(),         summary=String(),
                    files=Multilink("file"),
                    messageid=String(),  inreplyto=String())

Also, configuration is being cleaned up. This means that your dbinit.py will
also need to be changed in the open function. If you haven't changed your
dbinit.py, the above copy will be enough. If you have, you'll need to change
the line (round line 50)::

    db = Database(instance_config.DATABASE, name)

to::

    db = Database(instance_config, name)


0.4.0 Configuration
--------------------
``TRACKER_NAME`` and ``EMAIL_SIGNATURE_POSITION`` have been added to the
instance_config.py. The simplest solution is to copy the default values
from template in the core source.

The mail gateway now checks ``ANONYMOUS_REGISTER`` to see if unknown users
are to be automatically registered with the tracker. If it is set to "deny"
then unknown users will not have access. If it is set to "allow" they will be
automatically registered with the tracker.


0.4.0 CGI script roundup.cgi
----------------------------
The CGI script has been updated with some features and a bugfix, so you should
copy it from the roundup cgi-bin source directory again. Make sure you update
the ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES after the copy.


0.4.0 Nosy reactor
------------------
The nosy reactor has also changed - copy the nosyreactor.py file from the core
source::

   <roundup source>/roundup/templates/<template>/detectors/nosyreactor.py

to your instance home "detectors" directory.


0.4.0 HTML templating
---------------------
The field() function was incorrectly implemented - links and multilinks now
display as text fields when rendered using field(). To display a menu (drop-
down or select box) you need to use the menu() function.



Migrating from 0.2.x to 0.3.x
=============================

0.3.x Cookie Authentication changes
-----------------------------------
0.3.0 introduces cookie authentication - you will need to copy the
interfaces.py file from the roundup source to your instance home to enable
authentication. If you used the classic schema, the interfaces file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/interfaces.py

If you used the extended schema, the file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/interfaces.py

If you have modified your interfaces.Client class, you will need to take
note of the login/logout functionality provided in roundup.cgi_client.Client
(classic schema) or roundup.cgi_client.ExtendedClient (extended schema) and
modify your instance code apropriately.


0.3.x Password encoding
-----------------------
This release also introduces encoding of passwords in the database. If you
have not edited the dbinit.py file in your instance home directory, you may
simply copy the new dbinit.py file from the core code. If you used the
classic schema, the interfaces file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/dbinit.py

If you used the extended schema, the file is in::

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/dbinit.py


If you have modified your dbinit.py file, you may use encoded passwords:

1. Edit the dbinit.py file in your instance home directory
   a. At the first code line of the open() function::

       from roundup.hyperdb import String, Date, Link, Multilink

      alter to include Password, as so::

       from roundup.hyperdb import String, Password, Date, Link, Multilink

   b. Where the password property is defined (around line 66)::

       user = Class(db, "user",
                       username=String(),   password=String(),
                       address=String(),    realname=String(),
                       phone=String(),      organisation=String())
       user.setkey("username")

      alter the "password=String()" to "password=Password()"::

       user = Class(db, "user",
                       username=String(),   password=Password(),
                       address=String(),    realname=String(),
                       phone=String(),      organisation=String())
       user.setkey("username")

2. Any existing passwords in the database will remain cleartext until they
   are edited. It is recommended that at a minimum the admin password be
   changed immediately::

      roundup-admin -i <instance home> set user1 password=<new password>


0.3.x Configuration
-------------------
FILTER_POSITION, ANONYMOUS_ACCESS, ANONYMOUS_REGISTER have been added to
the instance_config.py. Simplest solution is to copy the default values from
template in the core source.

MESSAGES_TO_AUTHOR has been added to the IssueClass in dbinit.py. Set to 'yes'
to send nosy messages to the author. Default behaviour is to not send nosy
messages to the author. You will need to add MESSAGES_TO_AUTHOR to your
dbinit.py in your instance home.


0.3.x CGI script roundup.cgi
----------------------------
There have been some structural changes to the roundup.cgi script - you will
need to install it again from the cgi-bin directory of the source
distribution. Make sure you update the ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES after the
copy.
