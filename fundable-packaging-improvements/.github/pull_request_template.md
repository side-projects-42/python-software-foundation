<!--

Thanks for suggesting a fundable task!

Please check that your suggestion is:

 1. something the Python packaging community wants:
    - there's already consensus among project maintainers
    - if a PEP is involved, it's been accepted.

 2. fairly well-scoped

 3. fundable: would happen much faster if the Packaging Working Group got
    funding to implement the work, through donations or grants/directed gifts.
