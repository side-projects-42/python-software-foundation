Roundup Tracker Templates
=========================

The templates distributed with Roundup are stored in the "share" directory
nominated by Python. On Unix this is typically
``/usr/share/roundup/templates/`` (or ``/usr/local/share...``) and
on Windows this is ``c:\python22\share\roundup\templates\``.

The template loading looks in four places to find the templates:

1. *share* - eg. ``<prefix>/share/roundup/templates/*``.
   This should be the standard place to find them when Roundup is
   installed.
2. ``<roundup.admin.__file__>/../templates/*``.
   This will be used if Roundup's run in the distro (aka. source)
   directory.
3. ``<current working dir>/*``.
   This is for when someone unpacks a 3rd-party template.
4. ``<current working dir>``.
   This is for someone who "cd"s to the 3rd-party template dir.

Templates contain:

- modules ``schema.py`` and ``initial_data.py``
- directories ``html``, ``detectors`` and ``extensions``
  (with appropriate contents)
- optional ``config_ini.ini`` file. It is structured like a tracker's
  ``config.ini`` but contains only headers (e.g. ``[main]``) and
  *required* parameters that are different from defaults:
  e.g. ``template_engine = jinja2`` and ``static_files =
  static``. These settings override the default values saved to the
  tracker's ``config.ini``.
- template "marker" file ``TEMPLATE-INFO.txt``, which contains
  the name of the template, a description of the template
  and its intended audience.

An example TEMPLATE-INFO.txt::

 Name: classic
 Description: This is a generic issue tracker that may be used to track bugs,
              feature requests, project issues or any number of other types
              of issues. Most users of Roundup will find that this template
              suits them, with perhaps a few customisations.
 Intended-For: All first-time Roundup users
