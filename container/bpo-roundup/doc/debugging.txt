Debugging Aids
--------------

Try turning on logging of DEBUG level messages. This may be done a number
of ways, depending on what it is you're testing:

1. If you're testing the database unit tests, then set the environment
   variable ``LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG``. This may be done like so:

    LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG python run_tests.py

   This variable replaces the older HYPERDBDEBUG environment var.

2. If you're testing a particular tracker, then set the logging level in
   your tracker's ``config.ini``.

SENDMAILDEBUG
=============

Set to a filename and roundup will write each email message
that it sends to that file instead to the internet. 
This environment variable is independent of the python -O flag.
