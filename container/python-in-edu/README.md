### Postgres

If you don't have an installation of Postgres on your system, you might run into the following error:

```
Error: pg_config executable not found.
```

[Install Postgres](https://postgresapp.com/) to resolve this issue.

### Pillow

If your Pillow installation fails during installing the requirements with the following message:

```
The headers or library files could not be found for jpeg,
a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.
```

You can resolve this by installing [jpeg](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jpeg) using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
