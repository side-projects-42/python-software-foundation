I'm proud to release version 1.6.1 of Roundup which has been possible
due to the help of several contributors.  This release is a
bug fix release. If you are upgrading from a release earlier than
1.6.0 it includes important security enhancements, so make sure to
read `docs/upgrading.txt
<http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>`_ to bring your
tracker up to date.

Features:

  - doc updates. Link rot fixed and some grammar changes.
    'Provisional User' config example fixed. Issue tracker is
    now https. (John Rouillard) 

Fixed:

  - issue2550994: avoid breakage caused by use of backports of Python 3
    configparser module to Python 2. (Joseph Myers)
  - issue2551023: Fix CSRF headers for use with wsgi and cgi. The
    env variable array used - separators rather than _. Compare:
    HTTP_X-REQUESTED-WITH to HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH. The last is
    correct. Also fix roundup-server to produce the latter form. (Patch
    by Cedric Krier, reviewed/applied John Rouillard.)
  - issue2551035 - fix XSS issue in wsgi and cgi when handing url not
    found/404. Reported by hannob at
    https://github.com/python/bugs.python.org/issues/34, issue opened by
    JulienPalard.
  - issue2551029: Jinja2 template install error. Remove config.ini
    from templates to make sure that roundup-admin install writes a new
    default config.ini based on configuration.py.
  - issue2551029: Jinja2 template install error. Handle issue with
    template's config.ini not getting updated. Provide an alternate
    file: config_ini.ini for required config settings that are merged
    into the default values producing an up to date config.ini on
    install.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.7 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.7+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with five issue tracker templates

* a classic bug/feature tracker
* a minimal skeleton;
* a more extensive devel tracker for bug/features etc.
* a responsive version of the devel tracker
* a jinja2 based template based on devel

and can use any of four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql and
postgresql).
